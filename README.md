Skeleton-styles Modern UI Theme
===============================

Stylus version of the Skeleton CSS Boilerplate.
Based on the original work of Dave Gamache (http://getskeleton.com) this projects forks the 
original idea and add some modification to it.

If you want to use the unmodified and very clear and strict version of Skeleton, you can
check out the "original" branch. A modification branch is the "shortnames" branch, which
tries to reduce the css selector names to reduce the file size.

All other modifications are based on the "shortnames" branch and "master" is the playground.
If "master" reaches a state, which is the end of an modification it will end in its own branch.

This differs from the most used idea of using the "master" branch as a stable idea.

Branches
---------
  * original - 1:1 translation of Skeleton CSS to Skeleton Stylus version
  * shortnames - reduce filesize by using shorted CSS selectors
  * modern-ui - theme for modern-ui, based on original branch


Examples
---------
As the project evolves the number and the complexity of the examples should increase.

At the moment we have the following examples:

  * basic - Basic Template which shows only the Boilerplate on one page
  * registraion - A registration for to show the form elements
  * login - form demo of diffent positioning and width
  * marketing - some dummy thing
